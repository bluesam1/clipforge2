**Date:** January 2025  
**Next Phase:** Phase 1 - Import & Preview

## Recent Accomplishments

### âœ… Completed
1. **High-Level PRD** - Comprehensive product requirements document
2. **Phase-Specific PRDs** - 5 detailed implementation phases created
3. **Technology Stack** - Finalized with Tailwind CSS v4.0
4. **Memory Bank** - Complete project context and patterns documented
5. **Architecture Design** - System patterns and technical context defined

### ðŸ“‹ Phase Breakdown
- **Phase 1:** Import & Preview (~4.5 days)
- **Phase 2:** Timeline Core (~8 days)  
- **Phase 3:** Export Early (~5.5 days)
- **Phase 4:** Recording (~5.5 days)
- **Phase 5:** Polish & Performance (~7 days)
- **Total:** ~30 days development time

## Current Focus

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Environment Setup** - Initialize Electron + React + Tailwind v4.0 project
2. **Phase 1 Kickoff** - Begin Import & Preview implementation
3. **Core Infrastructure** - Set up IPC, state management, and basic UI

### Phase 1 Priorities
1. **Media Import System** - Drag-and-drop, file picker, validation
2. **Media Library UI** - Thumbnail display, metadata, selection
3. **Preview Player** - Video playback with controls
4. **FFmpeg Integration** - Metadata extraction and thumbnail generation

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Choices
- **Tailwind CSS v4.0** - Latest version with CSS-first configuration
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management (vs Redux)
- **FFmpeg** - Industry standard for media processing
- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop framework

### Architecture Decisions
- **Context Isolation** - Security-first approach
- **Local-Only** - No cloud dependencies
- **Project-Based Storage** - Structured file organization
- **Performance-First** - Canvas timeline, proxy system

### Design Decisions
- **Oracle Video Editor Style** - Clean, minimal aesthetic
- **Timeline-Centric** - Core editing interface
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Simple by default, advanced when needed

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges
1. **FFmpeg Integration** - Complex media processing pipeline
2. **Timeline Performance** - Smooth rendering with many clips
3. **Cross-Platform** - Ensuring consistent behavior
4. **Memory Management** - Handling large video files efficiently

### User Experience Focus
1. **First-Time User** - Intuitive onboarding experience
2. **Performance** - Responsive interface with 20+ clips
3. **Error Handling** - Clear, actionable error messages
4. **Workflow Efficiency** - Streamlined record â†’ edit â†’ export flow

### Quality Assurance
1. **Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, and E2E testing
2. **Performance Targets** - Specific metrics for responsiveness
3. **Cross-Platform Testing** - macOS and Windows validation
4. **User Testing** - Real user feedback and iteration

## Current Blockers
- **None** - Ready to begin development

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **FFmpeg Complexity** - Use proven libraries, extensive testing
- **Performance Issues** - Early optimization, user testing
- **Cross-Platform Bugs** - Regular testing on both platforms

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep** - Strict adherence to phase PRDs
- **Timeline Delays** - Buffer time built into estimates
- **Quality Issues** - Comprehensive testing strategy
