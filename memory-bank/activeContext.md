3. **Trimming System** - In/out points, clip duration adjustment
4. **Splitting** - Split clips at playhead position
5. **Timeline Integration** - Connect timeline to preview player

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Choices

- **Tailwind CSS v4.0** - Latest version with CSS-first configuration
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management (vs Redux)
- **FFmpeg** - Industry standard for media processing
- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop framework

### Architecture Decisions

- **Context Isolation** - Security-first approach
- **Local-Only** - No cloud dependencies
- **Project-Based Storage** - Structured file organization
- **Performance-First** - Canvas timeline, proxy system

### Design Decisions

- **Oracle Video Editor Style** - Clean, minimal aesthetic
- **Timeline-Centric** - Core editing interface
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Simple by default, advanced when needed

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges

1. **FFmpeg Integration** - Complex media processing pipeline
2. **Timeline Performance** - Smooth rendering with many clips
3. **Cross-Platform** - Ensuring consistent behavior
4. **Memory Management** - Handling large video files efficiently

### User Experience Focus

1. **First-Time User** - Intuitive onboarding experience
2. **Performance** - Responsive interface with 20+ clips
3. **Error Handling** - Clear, actionable error messages
4. **Workflow Efficiency** - Streamlined record â†’ edit â†’ export flow

### Quality Assurance

1. **Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, and E2E testing
2. **Performance Targets** - Specific metrics for responsiveness
3. **Cross-Platform Testing** - macOS and Windows validation
4. **User Testing** - Real user feedback and iteration

## Current Blockers

- **None** - Ready to begin development

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **FFmpeg Complexity** - Use proven libraries, extensive testing
- **Performance Issues** - Early optimization, user testing
- **Cross-Platform Bugs** - Regular testing on both platforms

### Project Risks

- **Scope Creep** - Strict adherence to phase PRDs
- **Timeline Delays** - Buffer time built into estimates
- **Quality Issues** - Comprehensive testing strategy
