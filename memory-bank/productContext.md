# Product Context: ClipForge

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Current video editing solutions fall into two categories:
1. **Professional tools** (Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve) - Overwhelming for simple tasks, expensive, complex
2. **Web-based editors** - Require internet, limited functionality, privacy concerns, subscription models

### Market Gap
There's a clear need for a **local, desktop video editor** that:
- Works offline (no cloud dependencies)
- Handles the most common editing tasks efficiently
- Has a clean, intuitive interface
- Doesn't require subscription or complex setup
- Focuses on the core creator workflow

### Target Users

- **Content Creators** - YouTubers, streamers, course creators
- **Educators** - Teachers creating instructional videos, online course creators
- **Professionals** - Business users creating presentations, training materials
- **General Users** - Anyone needing to quickly edit screen recordings or personal videos

**User Personas:**
1. **Sarah the Educator** - Creates online courses, needs to combine screen recordings with webcam footage
2. **Mike the Content Creator** - Makes YouTube videos, needs quick editing without subscription costs
3. **Lisa the Professional** - Creates training materials, needs reliable local editing

## How It Should Work
